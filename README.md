# udacity-popular-movies
Udacity Project. Popular Movies using TMDB API

Please paste in your TMDB API key in gradle.properties in the project root directory.

Here what you'll see here:
-- A very simple use of Retrofit 2 to query a REST API to fetch a list of movies.
-- Bare bones recycler view with a gridlayoutmanager, with a span of 2.
-- Picasso loads the images here for us.
-- Endless Scroller on the grid. Pages through the movies list.
-- Logging with Timber.
-- Stub to pipeline into Crashlytics at some point in the future.
